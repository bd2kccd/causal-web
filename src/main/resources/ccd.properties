ccd.app.welcome.p1='The Center for Causal Discovery has designed the CCD \
Application to facilitate causal modeling and discovery (CMD) on large \
datasets. To enable this capability, we have optimized the running time of the \
CMD algorithms using parallelization and caching techniques. Within a simple \
interface, a user can conduct an analysis locally on their desktop/laptop or \
choose to run their analysis remotely on more capable hardware at the \
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.'

ccd.app.welcome.p2='To start using this application, import and summarize a \
dataset in Data Management. Then select a CMD algorithm in Causal Discovery. \
We currently are making available only the Fast Greedy Search (FGS) algorithm \
for continuous data which outputs a whole causal graph from the input data. \
The application will guide you through this process of running the algorithm. \
You can view the status of an analysis in the Job Queue and view the results \
in Run Results.'
